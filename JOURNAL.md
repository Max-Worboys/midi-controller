## MIDI Controller

# May 31st 10:00 to 12:00

Started researching components required to build a 8x8 pad with faders.

Complete component list can be found in the readme.

# June 1st 14:00 to 16:00

Designed as PCB to house the 64 buttons:

Some other components may be housed on protoboards as kicad doesn't have footprints for them.

# June 1st 19:00 to 21:00

Finalised PCB Design.

The only component not on the pcb is the arduino micro as no footprint exists and I don't trust myself to make a correct one.

# June 2nd 19:00 to 21:00

Designed housing for the PCB in Fusion 360.

The main PCB sits 10 mm down from the top of the case and above the arduino which has a dedicated place at the back of the casing.
